This is a simple
[SDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol) library
designed for in-place modification of sdp lines.

## Why?

SDP parsing in browsers is relatively brittle (and not currently compliant
with the latest SDP RFC: [4566](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566)). This
library has been developed as an __interim__ approach for dealing with SDP
generated by a browser.

It follows the following rules:

- The order of SDP lines is never modified (in order = out order)

- SDP lines are not modified unless a specific tweak requires modifying the
  line.  That is, a line is not parsed and regenerated unless a particular
  modification operation requires it.

- Any new lines added to the SDP are added either after existing lines of
  the same time (for instance `a` lines), or if no other lines exist within
  the relevant scope, then immediately after the line type specified in the
  4566 RFC.

## Example Usage

To be completed.

## Alternative Options

object format, then any of the libraries below will do what you need:
