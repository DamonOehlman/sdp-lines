# sdp-lines

This is a simple
[SDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol) library
designed for in-place modification of sdp lines.

## Why?

SDP parsing in browsers is relatively brittle (and not currently compliant
with the latest SDP RFC: [4566](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566)). This
library has been developed as an __interim__ approach for dealing with SDP
generated by a browser.

It follows the following rules:

- The order of SDP lines is never modified (in order = out order)

- SDP lines are not modified unless a specific tweak requires modifying the
  line.  That is, a line is not parsed and regenerated unless a particular
  modification operation requires it.

- Any new lines added to the SDP are added either after existing lines of
  the same time (for instance `a` lines), or if no other lines exist within
  the relevant scope, then immediately after the line type specified in the
  4566 RFC.

## Example Usage

To be completed.

## Alternative Options

If you are looking for an SDP parser which works with an intermediate JS
object format, then any of the libraries below will do what you need:

## Related Information

The following standard documents are related to SDP with regards to WebRTC:

- <http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-sdp-01.html>
- <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3264>
- <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566>

### modify(regex, modifier)

The `modify` method is used to apply a change to the underlying data. When
a line matches the specified regex, the modifier function is invoked with
the following function signature:

```js
function modifier(line, match, type, payload) {
  // return the line to reinject back into the sdp
  return line;
}
```

The arguments to the following are as follows:

- `line`:    the full line that matched the regex
- `match`:   the match result from executing the regex
- `type`:    the line type which is specified prior to the = (e.g. `a`)
- `payload`: the payload of the line (after the = character)

In the sample modifier above, we simply return the line unchanged, but
we can reformat the line or replace it entirely.
